				<h2>Do you want to check your search results instantly? We invented a clever app just for that.</h2>
				The Green Web app does not only show you if a site your are visiting is hosted green, but works as well when you perform a search with Google, Bing or Yahoo. All results are labeled real-time on your screen, so you even know before visiting a site if it is hosted green!
				
				This holds true as well for links to green sites on webpages that you visit, which will be underlined subtly by a thin <a title="Example of link" href="#">green dashed line</a>.
